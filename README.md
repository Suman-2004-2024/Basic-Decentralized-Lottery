## Project Title

Basic Decentralized Lottery

## Project Description

The **Basic Decentralized Lottery** is a blockchain-based lottery platform where users can purchase tickets to participate, and the winner is selected randomly at the end of the lottery. The lottery's funds are stored and managed securely through a smart contract, ensuring transparency and fairness in the lottery process. The contract allows the owner to start and end the lottery, while players can buy tickets to participate.

All transactions and lottery outcomes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring trust and verifiability. The smart contract automatically distributes the prize to the winner and can be easily extended to support additional features.

## Project Vision

The vision of the **Basic Decentralized Lottery** is to create a fair, transparent, and automated lottery system. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures that all players have an equal chance of winning, and the lottery's outcome is tamper-proof. The platform aims to eliminate intermediaries and offer a decentralized alternative to traditional lottery systems.

## Future Scope

- **Multi-Winner Lotteries**: Extend the platform to allow multiple winners per lottery, with proportional prize distribution.
- **Automated Lottery Cycles**: Implement a system that automatically starts a new lottery cycle after the current one ends, making the platform more user-friendly and automated.
- **Public Lottery Pools**: Enable multiple lotteries to be managed in parallel, allowing users to join different pools.
- **Lottery Jackpot**: Introduce a jackpot feature where a portion of the funds is carried over to the next lottery if no winner is selected.
- **Lottery Tickets with NFT**: Introduce NFTs as tickets, where users receive unique digital tokens as proof of participation.
- **Lottery History and Transparency**: Implement a transparent public ledger to display all past lottery draws, winners, and prize amounts.

## Key Features

- **Ticket Purchase**: Players can buy tickets to participate in the lottery by sending Ether to the contract.
- **Owner Control**: Only the owner of the contract can start and end the lottery.
- **Random Winner Selection**: A pseudo-random function selects the winner based on the players participating in the lottery.
- **Prize Distribution**: The entire balance of the contract is transferred to the winner's address at the end of the lottery.
- **Transparency**: The smart contract ensures a transparent lottery process, as all operations are publicly recorded on the blockchain.
- **Simple and Decentralized**: The lottery is managed by the smart contract, eliminating the need for a trusted third party or intermediary.
